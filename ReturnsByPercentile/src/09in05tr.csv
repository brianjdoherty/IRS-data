"[1] The number of returns with negative adjusted gross income, i.e., returns with an adjusted gross deficit, and the 
corresponding amounts for adjusted gross deficit, were excluded from Table 5.  By excluding deficit returns, 
alternative minimum tax reported on some of these returns was also excluded.  For Tax Year 2009, there were 3,820
 returns with no adjusted gross income that reported income tax.  ",,,,,,,
"[2] The total number of returns does not include the returns filed by individuals to only receive the economic stimulus 
payment and who had no other reason to file.",,,,,,,
"[3] For Table 5, constant dollars were calculated using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index for urban
 consumers (CPI-U, 1982-84=100).  For 2009 the CPI-U = 214.537.",,,,,,,
"[4] Total income tax is income tax after credits (includes alternative minimum tax) reported on returns that showed a
 positive amount for adjusted gross income.  Therefore, total income tax excludes alternative minimum tax, Form 8814 tax
 (tax on a child's interest or dividends), and Form 4972 tax (tax on lump-sum distributions from qualified retirement plans)
 reported on some returns with a negative amount for adjusted gross income.  See also footnote 1.",,,,,,,
[5]  The average tax rate was computed by dividing total income tax (see footnote 4) by (positive) adjusted gross income.,,,,,,,
